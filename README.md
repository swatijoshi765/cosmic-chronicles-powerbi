COSMIC CHRONICLES: AN INTERACTIVE HISTORY OF SPACE EXPLORATION IN POWER BI

A comprehensive analysis of over 4,000 global space missions from the dawn of the space age to the modern commercial era.


PROJECT OVERVIEW

This Power BI project is a deep-dive analysis into the history of space exploration. Using a dataset of all recorded space missions since 1957, this report provides insights into historical trends, geopolitical competition, and the recent shift towards a commercialized space industry. The goal was to transform a raw dataset into a compelling, interactive, and user-friendly data story.

KEY FEATURES & ANALYSIS

This multi-page report allows users to explore the data from several perspectives:

  - Page 1: Mission Control Dashboard
    A high-level overview of all missions with key performance indicators (KPIs) like total launches and overall success rates. Features interactive slicers for year, company, and mission status, allowing for dynamic data filtering.

  - Page 2: The Space Race Analysis
    A focused historical deep-dive into the Cold War era (1957-1991). Directly compares the annual launch activity and success rates of the USA and the USSR.

  - Page 3: The Commercial Era Analysis
    A look at the modern space industry (2000-Present), highlighting the market share shift from government agencies to private companies and showcasing the dominance of players like SpaceX.

  - Page 4: Rocket Explorer Tool
    An interactive tool where users can select any rocket from a slicer to see its specific statistics. KPI cards and a detailed table update dynamically based on the user's selection.

TECHNICAL SKILLS & TOOLS

  - Business Intelligence Tool: Microsoft Power BI
  - Data Transformation (Power Query): Connected to CSV data source, performed extensive data cleaning, transformed data types, created conditional columns, and handled errors.
  - Data Modeling & DAX: Developed a robust "Success Rate" measure using DIVIDE and CALCULATE. Utilized simple aggregations like Count, Min, and Max.
  - Data Visualization & Design: Created a cohesive 4-page report with a consistent dark theme, clear titles, and a focus on data storytelling using a variety of visuals.
